================

Script for using Kongregate statistics from inside Unity.

<b>In Unity:</b>
* create an empty GameObject
* attach the Kongregate script
* in Kongregate.cs, implement and edit the <pre>'ExampleUpdateScore'</pre> method

<b>On Kongregate.com</b>
* upload your game
* add a statistic
* make sure the name matches the string in ExampleUpdateScore (or whatever you called it)
* make sure you enable 'Display in High Scores', otherwise you will never see the statistic (unless you implement reading it and displaying it in Unity into your game)

<b>Need more help?</b>
* talk to joon: @joonturbo (twitter)
